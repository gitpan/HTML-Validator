			HTML::Validator
			--------------

INTRODUCTION:

HTML::Validator is a perl module which can be used to check if the HTML file
conforms to the W3C standards. The checking is done with nsgmls (a SGML
syntax validator) and document type definition files. Neither of these are
distributed with HTML-Validator. Instructions about how to obtain these
is provided below.

HTML::Validator is based on a validator script I wrote in 1997-1998
<URL:http://www.iki.fi/si/kameli/>. Even though the principles of operation 
(nsgmls, LWP) are identical to those of some validator engines on the web 
<URL:http://validator.w3c.org/>, HTML::Validator uses none of their code.

XML files can also be validated; for this the nsgmls version needs to be 1.3
or greater.

REQUIREMENTS

 - perl (obviously)

 - nsgmls 

	- http://www.jclark.com/sp/howtoget.htm

 - document type definition files

	- you can use W3C's sgml library files that are
	  found from <URL:http://validator.w3.org/sgml-lib.tar.gz>
        - for XHTML the document type files can be downloaded from
          http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/xhtml1.zip

It is recommended that you also install LWP (libwww-perl), if you
want to validate documents on the web.

INSTALLATION

Quick way

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

To install the module in a non-standard location you can use

   perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/lib

The Makefile is written with ExtUtils::MakeMaker, so it supports all the 
other standard options. See the manual page of that module for more
information.

For more information, see the web page.

VALIDATION

A sample validator script 'validate' is included with this package.


DOCUMENTATION

Documentation is provided with a manual page, which is automatically
generated by the information contained in the module itself.
The most up-to-date documentation will be found from the home page,
which is located at <URL:http://www.iki.fi/si/HTML-Validator/>.
